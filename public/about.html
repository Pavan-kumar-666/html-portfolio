<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><pre>Hello! I’m Animela Pavan Kumar, currently pursuing my final year of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

at Alliance University, Bangalore.

My primary focus is to become a skilled Full Stack Developer, and I’ve already started building real-world applications. I’ve developed two full-stack projects using HTML, CSS, PHP,

MySQL, and XAMPP.

The first is an E-book Management System, which includes login and signup pages, an admin panel to manage books, and features like book listings, cart, favorites, and download

— all fully connected to a backend database.

My second project is StudentConnect, a student portal system that includes login, profile management, timetable display, attendance tracking, and resource access. 

It simulates a real college portal and is built with dynamic backend integration.

Along with project development, I’m learning Java, and I regularly practice problem-solving on HackerRank and LeetCode to improve my coding and algorithmic thinking.

I’m also following structured courses on Udemy to strengthen my understanding of frontend and backend frameworks, and to build complete applications from scratch.

I’ve completed several certifications on Coursera, including:

Foundations of Business Intelligence – Google
Power BI Fundamentals – CFI
Machine Learning with Python – IBM
Supervised Machine Learning – IBM
Generative AI with Large Language Models – DeepLearning.AI
Relational Database Design – University of Colorado Boulder
Introduction to Agile and Scrum – IBM

These courses helped me build a foundation in areas like machine learning, databases, agile development, and business intelligence.

My career goal is to become a strong and adaptable Full Stack Developer, capable of building scalable, user-focused applications and growing continuously in the software

 development industry.

Outside academics, I enjoy playing cricket and kabaddi, which have taught me valuable skills like teamwork, discipline, and strategic thinking — qualities I bring into
 my technical work as well.

Thank you for taking the time to watch my video!</pre></p>
